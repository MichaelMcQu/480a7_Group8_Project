* Install Pydriller, matplotlib, and Pandas
* Once scripts are loaded into desired IDE run the Python script merge_time.py, commit_frequency.py to get the data into a .csv file
* From there run the second Python script named plot_merge_time.py, plot_commit_frequency.py this is how we plotted the data using matplotlib (Note: the name of the file should match the strings being passed referencing the CSVs)
* The output from the Python script should be a plotted graph representing the corrolation between hours or time it took to merge a PR during a specific month within the year.
* These steps are repeated to find get the data for commit frequency
